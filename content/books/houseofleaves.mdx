- My all-time favorite book â€” House of Leaves, holds the dearest place in my heart.  
I first read it at 15, as a confused shell of myself. 
It forever changed the course of not only how I view literature, but how I view my life.  
Even what I want my own art to breathe towards, one day.  

- I wanted to change the world with my art since the first stumblings I ever had, I wanted to know that I could be as important alongside it.
