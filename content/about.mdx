<br />
<p> Hey there,<br />—I'm Alice! <br />

An <em>engineer, composer & writer,</em> growing up in the surrounding DMV areas.<br />
My art has been circulating for nearly a decade now, most laying online, and within my Soundcloud — being free to explore.<br /><br />
The alias for it all lies in, [***freya langley***](https://soundcloud.com/atimetowait) — A name w/ its roots in playing MMOs growing up, a place where I could be anyone I want. <br />

I write formally as my chosen name & keep up-to-date journals on my [Substack](https://yapperofwords.com), as well as under — [musings](https://atimetowait.com/musings).<br /> 
Currently, I'm in the process of writing a novel named —<br /><br />
### ***This Bias Is Beginning to Show***  
  > — An autobiographical fiction that follows, Astoria.<br />  — A girl stricken w/ the guilt of an endless possibility in a future with no control, the tribulation of a manifesting unknown <em> decay. </em> <br />
> — And the battle of honoring the past, present, and in a fading future, holding onto solace through its remains.

<br />
Write back w/ any thoughts that are in your head.
