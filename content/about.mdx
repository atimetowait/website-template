<pre><em>Hey there,</em>
Welcome to my site — a place for any thought experiments, formal writing, and anything else I find interesting enough to talk about, really.

<em>My name is Alice :)</em>
To myself, I'm an artist, creative, most importantly...a human-being.

I've released music under the alias, [freya langley.](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4M8EnFxggAM0jWTedB5Qer?si=HYn9IqzpR_2Pkg1SLAmMiA) 
For years now, the genres span anywhere from ambient, neoclassical compositions. To distortion-fused electronic. Most of which, is produced by myself or with the help of close friends.

Alongside music, 
I also write a novel named [This Bias is Beginning to Show.](https://www.atimetowait.com/this-bias-is-beginning-to-show)
It's written through the lens of an autobiographical fiction. One partially following mine, and the character of Astoria's life.
You'll find themes of grief, mortality, and hopefully a comfort in even through decay more of <em>you</em> can lie underneath...whatever it is we are, that is.

Reach out with any thoughts in your head, send me a note anonymously via [What's Your Name?](https://www.atimetowait.com/whats-your-name)
Or simply email me via [atimetowait@gmail.com](mailto:atimetowait@gmail.com)
There's never such a thing as a stranger...be well.
xoxo
