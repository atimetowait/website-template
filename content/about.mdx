<br />
<p> Hey there,<br />—I'm Alice! <br />

An <em>engineer, composer & writer</em> from the surrounding DMV areas.<br />
My art has been circulating online for nearly a decade now, most laying within my Soundcloud — being free to explore.<br /><br />
The alias for music endeavors lie in, ***freya langley*** — A name w/ its roots from playing MMOs growing up, it was one near to my heart. <br />

I write formally as my chosen name & keep up-to-date journals on my Substack.<br /> 
Currently...I'm in the process of a novel named,<br /><br />
***This Bias Is Beginning to Show***<br /> — An autobiographical fiction that follows, Astoria.<br />  — A girl stricken w/ guilt by the endless possibility of a future no longer for her. <br /><br />
Write back w/ any thoughts that are in your head. 

***-Alice***<br />
***xoxo***
