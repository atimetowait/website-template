To distortion-fused electronic. Most of which, is produced by myself or with the help of close friends.</p>\n<p>Alongside music, \nI also write a novel named <a href=\"https://www.atimetowait.com/this-bias-is-beginning-to-show\">This Bias is Beginning to Show.</a>\nIt&#39;s written through the lens of an autobiographical fiction. One partially following mine, and the character of Astoria&#39;s life.\nYou&#39;ll find themes of grief, mortality, and hopefully a comfort in even through decay more of <em>you</em> can lie underneath...whatever it is we are, that is.</p>\n<p>Reach out with any thoughts in your head, send me a note anonymously via <a href=\"https://www.atimetowait.com/whats-your-name\">What&#39;s Your Name?</a>\nOr simply email me via <a href=\"mailto:atimetowait@gmail.com\">atimetowait@gmail.com</a>\nThere&#39;s never such a thing as a stranger...be well.\nxoxo</p>\n<p>-alice</p>\n"
