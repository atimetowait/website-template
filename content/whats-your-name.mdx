title: "WHAT'S YOUR NAME?"
---

For so long I toiled to find answers in names, people, myself...for that mattter. <br />
<br />Solitude, maybe solace. 
<br />Lies in honesty, vulnerability — An openness to your own wounds. <br />
<br /> What is said, cannot be taken back.<br />But those in the process of a doing. <br /> Hold weight to right a wrong that might just become a new verb, word — function of their own causality to change our paracausal forces...forever.
