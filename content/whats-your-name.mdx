title: "WHAT'S YOUR NAME?"
---

For so long I toiled to find answers in names, people, myself...for that manner. <br />
<br />Solitude grants maybe, solace. 
<br />It lays in honesty though, vulnerability — An openness to your own wounds. <br />
<br /> What is said, cannot be taken back.<br />
> But those in the process of a doing. <br /> Hold the weight to right a wrong that just might become a new verb, word — a new function of their own causality to change our paracausal forces...forever.
