This is an example note to demonstrate how the content system works.

You can write your thoughts, essays, or any content you'd like to share here. The MDX format gives you full control over your writing with support for:

- **Markdown formatting** for rich text
- Frontmatter for metadata (title, date, excerpt)
- Custom React components (if you want to extend it)

## Getting Started

Simply edit this file in `content/notes/` or create new `.mdx` files to add your own content.

The build system will automatically process your content and make it available on your site.
