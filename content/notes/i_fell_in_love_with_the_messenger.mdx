title: I fell in love with the messenger
date: "Stopping to stare only leaves you on the offbeat"
excerpt: ""

Call your fault, for down below...yourself lingers. <br>
Match to light, black to grey, seemingly nothing exists in a chasm like it — before.<br>
But there's dispondence in pleasure, mortal forms in selfless acts. <br>
A way to find hope, have it, incarnated with the thing it was stilled.
Does your nature change when you are thrust into the light? Or... <br>
Is whatever is laying in your subtleties, ache? New? Newer? Than before? <br>
The messenger wasn't a cause for a dispondence, but your love for her made you forget the very thing that made black, light.<br>
Your other equal, her last footing to get past you, heed a call or forever live on top the acres, no - mounds of doubt that brought you to her all again.<br>
You were an equal, and oh — how it has shot you down.
