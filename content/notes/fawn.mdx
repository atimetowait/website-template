I wanted to understand you for so long. <br />
Knowledge of intricacy, graphite skin - touch so oriented you would just know, <br />
that it would only belong to you.<br />

Eyes that pierce veils on wedding days,<br />
All the marks, and marks...so many of them, now.<br />
Ones that would wash off, <br />
and others that won't <br />

I want them to see the ones that won't.<br />

The new hue on every shade of me<br />
The new tone of each lullaby<br />
the ones I would sing when I would get scared<br />
the one i would sing when i would get so frightened by the thought of evermore<br />
the one that is repeating, Be Still, I would. <br />
hoping the room would echo back a different reverberated hymn <br />
so this time, be different. I would repeat hoping you would still return back an exit wound.<br />
be, there. so i can still recognize my own reflection in the unfamiliarity of crowds <br />
the ones where everyone knows I'm me, but where i fail to understand myself.<br />

you're my allure, my god.<br />
my silence that move the wakes<br />
a cowardly form that would only insult the nature <br />
to describe a dear presence,<br />
of something ever the more deep, as you are tall<br />
as suffocating as you are beautiful.<br />
and as captivating as the crowd that would still sing for an eternity <br />
if only to bring back the one singular melody<br />
of the very first song <br />
that made you fall for me.
