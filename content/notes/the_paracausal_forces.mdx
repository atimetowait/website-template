> ####  ***These paracausal forces that keep us all together, I feel them call my *name,* but I can't help but wonder...why?***<br />

I'm becoming frightened again, easily.<br />
and it keeps happening within my unconcious self.<br /><br />
Night-terrors w/ demons drenched in opaquenes, I squirm at the thought of them grabbing me alive this next time.<br />
Manifesting my curses with these feeble bare hands, just hoping to withstand the fall, I *can't* take this anymore.<br />
> #### ***I think, and I think some more.***<br />
And that's all I ever do...think.
