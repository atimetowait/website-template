> ####  ***These paracausal forces that keep us all together, I feel them call my *name,* but I can't help but wonder...why?***<br />

I'm becoming frightened again easily.<br />
and it keeps happening within my unconcious self.<br /><br />
Night-terrors w/ demons drenched in opaquenes, I squirm at the thought of them grabbing me alive this next time.<br />
Manifesting my curses with these feeble bare hands, just hoping to withstand the fall, I *can't* take this anymore.<br />
> #### ***I think, and I think some more.***<br />
And that's all I ever do...is think.

Outrunning the undertow, you can try...sure, you can *try*.<br />
But it will take you, and take every last strength in those muscles of yours you use to stay afloat.  
It will pull you down,<br /> it will curl those fibered tendons. <br />The one's that are so strong, the ones you've always used to stay...afloat.<br />
Those will falter too, much like the strength keeping your head above the surface tension. Bobbing in, and then out.<br /><br />
Now you know the struggle of fate.  
<br />And the ideal in, there's no running, let alone swimming.<br />Out of it.
